:*'''MYO1C''' [MYO1C] (myosin 1C) is a component of the ''F-actin network''. MYO1C is a monomeric class I myosin, which associates with cholesterol lipid rafts. It contains a PH domain that binds specifically to PI(4,5)P2. It is a "slow" motor, ideal for translocating heavy cargos, not tethering, and thus is able to move lipid rafts from storage compartments to their site of action. {{#pmid: 27146966|Kruppa2016}}
:*'''PI(4,5)P2''' (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) is a component of the ''F-actin network''. PI(4,5)P2 clusters at lipid rafts in a cholesterol and Ca2+ dependent fashion. These clusters bind the ARP2/3 complex. {{#pmid: 30692198 |Bucki2019}}

====Ion regulation====
{{Smallvspace}}

====Fusion mechanism====
{{Smallvspace}}

*A '''SNAREpin team''' is a component of the ''PHALY'' system. From three to six SNAP29-STX17-VAMP8 SNARE-pins form a mechanically coupled SNAREpin team in a rigid membrane (cholesterol lipid-raft) which accelerates fusion by four orders of magnitude. {{#pmid: 30700546 |Manca2019}}

====Disassembly and recycling====
{{Smallvspace}}
*The '''20s supercomplex''' is a component of the ''PHALY'' system. The 20s supercomplex forms around the cis-SNARE complex, by binding two to four molecules of alpha-SNAP and an NSF homohexamer to the cis-SNARE-pin.{{#pmid: 25581794|Zhao2015}}
*'''alpha-SNAP''' [NAPA] (NSF attachment protein alpha) is a component of the ''20s supercomplex''. Two to four molecules of cytoplasmic alpha-SNAP wrap around the cis-SNARE-pin to form a SNAP-SNARE subcomplex. {{#pmid: 25581794|Zhao2015}}
*'''NSF''' [NSF] (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) is a component of the ''20s supercomplex''. NSF is a cytoplasmic AAA+ ATPase that binds to the SNAP-SNARE subcomplex in an ATP-bound state. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis induces major conformational rearrangements of NSF that disassociate the SNARE-pin into individual constituent molecules. Nucleotide exchange presumably disassociates the remaining NSF-SNAP subcomplex, and allows the cycle to restart.{{#pmid: 25581794|Zhao2015}}
*'''TBC1D2''' [TBC1D2] (TBC1 domain family member 2A) is a component of the ''PHALY'' system. TBC1D2 (Armus) is a RAB7 specific GAP that activates hydrolysis of RAB7 bound GTP to GDP and thus catalyzes conversion of RAB7 to its inactive state. {{#pmid: 30333976 |Stroupe2018}}
